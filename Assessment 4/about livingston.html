		 	18-year-old Pop singer, songwriter, AND producer, Livingston, recently hit the scene with his debut EP release, Lighthouse, with Elektra Records. Billboard announced Livingston’s signing to Elektra Records while also premiering his debut single, “Fairytale”.

			Drawing inspiration from some of Pop’s biggest names and some of the most notable composers of our time, Livingston brings incredible, raw vocals to bouncy, Pop tracks, paired with relatable lyrics addressing loneliness, isolation, and feeling misplaced. Livingston describes it as “orchestral cinematic pop”.

			On the track, the 17-year-old pop singer shouts out Pixar films like A Bug's Life, WALL-E, The Incredibles and Toy Story, while grappling with harsh realities of growing up. "At age of nine, I lived through Pixar on a screen/ And every single problem seemed so little then to me/ 'Cause Flik still saved the anthill even though I couldn't see beyond/ The kids at school that hated me and my insecurity/ Oh I thought I was invincible/ But Mr. Incredible could only take so much," he croons on the melancholy single.

			Fairytale' is about the moment where someone you look up to lets you down," Livingston, who hails from Denton, Texas, tells Billboard. "Putting this idea in the form of Pixar superheroes felt like the right way for me to tell my story. Everyone knows these stories and their moral lessons, so drawing from them gave me a really easy starting point to express my warning about putting all of your faith in someone who is just as human as you are

			We knew there was something special about Livingston from the moment we met him," add Elektra Music Group co-presidents Mike Easterlin and Gregg Nadel. "At seventeen years old, it’s already evident he is a true artist -- from writing and recording to mixing and producing all on his own, we know it’s just the beginning for Livingston. We couldn’t be more excited to welcome him to the Elektra family.
